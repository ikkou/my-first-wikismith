It was created to perform installation of modules to make the install tree \"correct\" during the initial install as well as subsequent package.json dependency updates.\n\n## install\n\nTo use via the CLI, install globally with the -g flag. `npm-install` can also be used as a module\n\n### for CLI use\n\n```shell\nnpm install -g npm-install\n```\n\n### for the module api\n\n```shell\nnpm install npm-install\n```\n\n## why\n\n`npm install` is slightly broken when it comes to performing an installation on an already partially installed tree [#3124](https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/3124) and the `npm update` command is too aggressive and typically wants to update everything.\n\nThis modules does not perform any sort of de-duplication.\n",
